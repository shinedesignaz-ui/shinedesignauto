    // FAQ data
    const FAQS = [
      // Detailing basics
      ["Do you come to my location?", "Yes. We are fully mobile across Gilbert, Mesa, Chandler, Queen Creek, San Tan Valley, Scottsdale, Tempe, and nearby areas."],
      ["Do you bring water and power?", "Yes. Our vans are self-contained with pure water, power, and lighting. We only need safe access to the vehicle."],
      ["How long does an interior detail take?", "Typical interior services take 2–3 hours. Heavy stain removal, pet hair, and odor treatments add time."],
      ["How long does an exterior detail take?", "Usually 2–3 hours for wash, decon, and protection. Add time for clay, iron removal, and correction."],
      ["What is paint decontamination?", "A two-step process: iron remover to dissolve embedded ferrous particles, followed by a clay bar to remove bonded contaminants."],
      ["What is paint correction?", "Machine polishing that levels micro-scratches and swirls. One-step improves gloss. Multi-step targets heavier defects."],
      ["DA vs rotary polishers?", "Dual-action polishers are safer and finish well. Rotary tools cut faster but require more skill and finish refinement."],
      ["Can you remove deep scratches?", "We can reduce or remove many scratches. If you feel a scratch with a fingernail, full removal may require sanding or touch-up."],
      ["Do you clean engine bays?", "Yes, on request. We use controlled rinsing and plastic-safe protection. Not performed on hot engines."],
      ["Do you clean headliners?", "Light, low-moisture cleaning only. Aggressive scrubbing can delaminate headliner glue."],

      // Ceramic coating
      ["What does a ceramic coating do?", "It bonds to clear coat to add gloss, hydrophobics, UV and chemical resistance, and makes washing easier."],
      ["How long do coatings last?", "Our tiers range from 1–5+ years with proper care. Longevity depends on wash method, mileage, and storage."],
      ["Do I still need to wash a coated car?", "Yes. Coatings reduce effort but do not stop dirt. Use pH-neutral soaps and proper tools."],
      ["Can I take a coated car through touch washes?", "We do not recommend. Touch washes add swirls and can degrade hydrophobics."],
      ["How soon can it get wet after coating?", "Avoid water for 12–24 hours if possible. If it gets wet, gently dry to avoid spotting."],
      ["Do coatings prevent rock chips?", "No. Coatings add hardness but do not absorb impacts. Use PPF for chip-prone zones."],
      ["Will a coating hide scratches?", "No. It enhances gloss but does not fill defects. Correction before coating is recommended."],
      ["Can you coat matte paint or PPF?", "Yes. We use matte-safe coatings that preserve a satin finish without adding gloss."],
      ["Do you coat glass, wheels, and trim?", "Yes. Optional glass, wheel, and trim coatings improve clarity, brake dust release, and fade resistance."],
      ["What maintenance is required?", "Regular hand washes, periodic decon, and topper applications restore slickness and beading."],

      // PPF
      ["What is PPF?", "Paint protection film is an 8–10 mil urethane that absorbs impacts and resists chips, stains, and etching."],
      ["How thick is PPF?", "Most premium films are about 8 mil (200 microns) plus adhesive. Thicker options exist for track use."],
      ["Is PPF self-healing?", "Yes. Many films self-heal light swirls with engine heat or warm sun."],
      ["Will PPF yellow?", "Modern aliphatic TPU films resist yellowing. Proper maintenance and reputable brands minimize risk."],
      ["Edges and seams visible?", "We wrap edges where safe and use templates or bulk installs to hide seams when possible."],
      ["PPF coverage options?", "Partial front, full front, rocker panels, high-impact areas, or full-body. We tailor to commute and budget."],
      ["Can you apply PPF on repainted panels?", "Yes, after proper cure. Fresh paint often needs 30–60 days to off-gas depending on system."],
      ["PPF on headlights legal?", "In AZ, clear protective film on headlights is typically allowed. Colored tints may not be. Confirm local law."],
      ["PPF after ceramic?", "Install PPF first, then coat on top for easier maintenance."],
      ["PPF warranty?", "Manufacturer warranties commonly cover yellowing, cracking, and delamination. We stand behind workmanship."],

      // Window tint
      ["What tint shades do you offer?", "Multiple VLT options from very light to limo. We also offer ceramic/IR films for heat rejection."],
      ["AZ tint law basics?", "Common guidance: front windows must be lighter than rears. Laws can vary; we offer AZ-legal setups."],
      ["Does ceramic tint look darker?", "No. Darkness is VLT. Ceramic films block heat and IR without being darker."],
      ["Will tint bubble or purple?", "Quality films have stable dyes and adhesives. Poor films degrade. We install premium films with warranty."],
      ["Can you tint windshields?", "We offer legal, very light heat-rejecting films and sun strips where allowed."],
      ["How long before rolling windows down?", "24–48 hours in warm weather. Longer if cold or humid."],
      ["Do defroster lines or dot matrices cause issues?", "We squeegee carefully. Minor edge silvering on heavy dot matrices is normal."],
      ["Can tint be removed later?", "Yes. We use steam and adhesive cleaners to reduce residue."],
      ["Does tint go on the outside?", "No. Film is applied inside after cleaning and patterning."],
      ["Tint warranty?", "Covers bubbling, peeling, color change, and adhesive failure under normal use."],

      // Logistics and policies
      ["How do I book?", "Use our online booking link, text, or call. We confirm time, address, and vehicle details."],
      ["Do you require a deposit?", "For larger services like coatings, PPF, or fleet work we may request a deposit to hold time."],
      ["What is your cancellation policy?", "Please give 24 hours notice. Same-day cancels may incur a fee, especially for long-block services."],
      ["Rain policy?", "We work under shade or reschedule for coatings and PPF. Light rain does not stop most interior work."],
      ["Access and parking needs?", "A safe, reasonably flat space with room to open doors fully. Garages or shade are ideal for correction/coating."],
      ["HOA or gated communities?", "We comply with rules. Please arrange gate codes or access instructions."],
      ["Do you service apartments?", "Yes where allowed. We coordinate parking and power if needed. Our vans are self-contained."],
      ["Payment methods?", "Cards, cash, and invoice links are available. Ask about business invoicing and fleets."],
      ["Do you work weekends?", "Yes. We schedule seven days a week when availability allows."],
      ["Satisfaction guarantee?", "If something is missed, contact us within 48 hours. We correct it quickly."],

      // Interior specifics
      ["Can you remove pet hair?", "Yes. Heavy pet hair requires additional time and an add-on fee."],
      ["Do you remove seats?", "Usually no. We use specialized tools to reach under rails. Some vehicles allow limited removal when justified."],
      ["Odor removal and ozone?", "We clean source materials first. Ozone or enzyme treatments follow for stubborn odors."],
      ["Carpet stains and salt?", "Hot-water extraction and targeted chemistry remove most staining without residue."],
      ["Leather cleaning and protection?", "We clean with pH-balanced products and add matte protectant to resist dye transfer and UV cracking."],
      ["Child seat policy?", "We can clean around them. For liability we do not reinstall child seats."],

      // Exterior specifics
      ["Do you remove water spots?", "Yes. Light spots polish out. Etched spots may require correction or PPF for prevention."],
      ["Do you handle tar or overspray?", "Yes with safe solvents and clay. Overspray severity determines time and cost."],
      ["Trim restoration?", "We clean and re-dye or coat plastics. Longevity depends on UV exposure and product used."],
      ["Badge or decal removal?", "We use heat and adhesive removers. Ghosting may require polishing."],
      ["Sunroof and glass care?", "We clay and polish glass and can apply dedicated glass coatings for clarity and wiper reduction."],
      ["Wheel and caliper cleaning?", "Iron removers and pH-balanced wheel gels protect finishes. Coatings help brake dust release."],

      // Specialty and fleets
      ["Do you service RVs and boats?", "Yes. We offer exterior washing, oxidation removal, and protection for gelcoat and large vehicles."],
      ["Motorcycles and UTVs?", "Yes. We adjust methods for plastics, wraps, and off-road finishes."],
      ["EV-specific care?", "Yes. We avoid charge ports and use coatings that ease bug removal and reduce static dust."],
      ["New car prep vs dealership wash?", "We remove transport film and address dealer-induced swirls before protection so the finish starts right."],
      ["After body shop work?", "Fresh paint needs cure time. We can safely wash and later correct and protect after off-gassing."],
      ["Do you offer fleet or business plans?", "Yes. Ask about recurring maintenance for company vehicles and mobile teams."]
